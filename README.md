## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# setup firestore credentials in nuxt.config.js

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# start firestore emulator
$ firebase emulators:start
```

## Extra Thoughts

Alternatively, adding and fetching user inputs from Firestore can also be done using Firestore dependency for nuxt without going through Axios and using https function or using the Firestore dependency in the Firestore functions.
